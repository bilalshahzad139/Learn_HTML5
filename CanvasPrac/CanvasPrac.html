        /*
        -> <canvas> is an HTML element which can be used to draw graphics using scripting (usually JavaScript).
        -> The <canvas> element isn't supported in some older browsers, but is supported in recent versions of all major browsers.
        -> The default size of the canvas is 300px * 150px (width * height).
        -> A <canvas> element has no content and no border of its own.
        -> Fallback content: We can provide some content (text/img etc.) inside tags so if browser doesn't support canvas tag, this
        content will be shown to the user.
        -> <canvas> only supports one primitive shape: rectangles. All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths.
